# This is my first ever project in Python wherein I didn't do code along. 
However, along the way, I thought it was impossible to do this, but it turns out that it's possible to do so. I would like to thank one of my Discord friends who suggested this simple project for Python as I am mastering my fundamentals to become a QA Engineer so that I will also know not only manual testing, but also automation testing. 
I may not be a QA Engineer yet so I am not very knowledgeable on both kinds of software testing, but I will get there someday.
To be honest, I want to get out of the call center industry because I don't see myself making this job as a career in the long run as this line of work will affect my physical 
and mental health negatively in the long run.
I may not be able to fulfill those dreams today, but someday, I'll get there even though it may take a while given that I am in a harder situation now to be honest.
